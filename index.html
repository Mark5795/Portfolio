				My name is Daniele Petrarolo, I'm a Web Developer from Como, Italy.
				My job is my biggest passion (this is really cool, don't you think?). I love design and develop web sites because I think that this is a beatiful way to express creativity and communicate with people all over the world. I love to write beatiful code because this is fu****g fun! 
				I've studied Computer Science at University of Insubria, but every day I try to discover new ways of development and new ways to improve my skills: coding is my life! 
				At the moment I work as Web Developer at Vergani&Gasco, an amazing web agency from my home-town. :)
